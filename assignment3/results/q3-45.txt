Q3.4
Frequency resolution is sample rate / length of fft bins
In the implementation, the sample rate is 44100 Hz and number of bins is 22050
Frequency resolution = 44100/22050 = 2Hz/bin

Q3.5
Add zero paddings to to the time domain will increase length of fft bins,
taking the same sample rate will cause frequency resolution smaller.
